# Pitch Your Voice

Author: Yu Tian

This is my first swift ios app, and I leant it from Udacity course, Intro to IOS and Swift. 
The app is a simple to demo to show how to manipulate audio via UIKit and AVFoundation.

The function of app is that user could record a audio clip, then change the speed of audio (via rate) 
or the pitch of audio ( via pitch). 

The UI of app is also simple, 2 viewControllers, the first one with 2 buttons (record and stop),
and the second with 5 buttons (fast, slow, high pitch, low pitch, and stop). The app has been tested
and working well. The pictures for the button are from Google Pictures.

Environment: Xcode Version 6.4
